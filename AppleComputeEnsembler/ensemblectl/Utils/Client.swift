// The ensembledframework getTlsOptions() API expose the NWProtocolTLS.Options.
// There is no way to test this easily, and one way to rely on TIE team to test this for us.
// Now with the client server, we get the tlsOptions from ensembled and use Network Framework APIs
// to establish mtls communication between server and client.
// To use it, run esenmblectl run-server <port> on a node, and on other node/nodes, run ensemblectl
// run-client <port> <server>
